# Python_project_1
 In this , we build a Python Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API, we extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.
We start this project by first creating an YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access youtube data. I  created an API Key. 
Once the API Key is generated, we will then learn how to use this API key to access different youtube data. I.e. we will walk through the documentation given by google to use youtube API. We will look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data we need to build this project. We will also look at the sample python code given by google to call different resources and methods to fetch youtube data.



Then,  build a logic to extract video details from a particular channel. We shall extract details such as video title, total views each video has got, total number of likes, dislikes and comments each video has got. We shall extract these details for all of the videos posted by a particular channel. We will then analyze this data by loading it into a pandas dataframe. At the end we will create some simple visualization using Seaborn python library.
